📊 Data Visualization Task – Skillcraft Technology
This repository contains my submission for Task 01 at Skillcraft Technology. The goal of this task was to create meaningful visualizations based on the provided datasets using Python.

🔍 Task Objective:
Create visualizations to represent the distribution of categorical or continuous variables.
For this task, the following were visualized:
📌 Number of countries by Region
📌 Number of countries by Income Group

📁 Files Included:
dataset01.csv – Metadata (not used for visualizations)
dataset02.csv – Main data for visualization (Region, Income Group, etc.)
dataset03.csv – Indicator metadata
task01_visualization.ipynb – Google Colab notebook containing full code and output

📊 Visualizations:
Bar Chart: Countries per Region
Bar Chart: Countries per Income Group
These plots were created using:
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib

🛠️ Tools & Environment:
Google Colab
Python
Data Science Libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)

🚀 How to Run:
Open the notebook task01_visualization.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter
Upload the CSV files when prompted (if running locally)
Run the cells to view the charts

🙌 Acknowledgment:
This task was completed as part of the Data Science Internship at Skillcraft Technology
